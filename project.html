                    <p> The Taj Mahal is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, 
                        India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite 
                        wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) 
                        complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated

                    <h3>RED FORT</h3>
                    <p> Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that historically served as the 
                        main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he 
                        decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad 
                        Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and
                         combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions &nbsp;<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Fort">Read More...</a></b></p>
